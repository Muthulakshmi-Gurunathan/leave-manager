We already have implemented the authentication with JWT. Now we have to implement the role based authorization to this springboot app.

The MANAGER role will act as Admin.
The EMPLOYEE role will act as Normal User.

The EMPLOYEE is the one who applies for the leave.
The MANAGER is the one who approves the leave.

The MANAGER is also an EMPLOYEE who will get the leave request approved from his MANAGER.
